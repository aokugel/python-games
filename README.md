# Snake

Snake is a fun little snake game built in python.  

## Installation

First, make sure you have python 3 installed.  [You can download that here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Second, install pygame using the following command

```bash
pip install pygame
```
Finally, open either powershell or command prompt, navigate to the directory that contains snake.py and run:

```
python ./snake.py
```

## Usage

Right now you have to run this game from idle.  Currently working on fixing that.
